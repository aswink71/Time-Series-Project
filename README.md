# Time Series Prediction of Saudi Stock Market

This repository contains the code and methodology for predicting the Saudi stock market using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on univariate and multivariate time series analysis.

## Project Overview
The project aims to forecast the stock prices of three major telecom companies in Saudi Arabia—STC, Mobily, and Zain. Using historical stock data, we explore machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to analyze and predict future stock prices.

### Features
Univariate and Multivariate Time Series Analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Standard Scaling and Wavelet Denoising.
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Regression and Artificial Neural Networks.
Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², and MAPE.
### Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
### Libraries:
Data Manipulation: numpy, pandas
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: sklearn, keras
Statistical Analysis: statsmodels
